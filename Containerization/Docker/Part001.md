#### What is Containerization ?

* Containerization is a type of virtualization in which all the components of an application are bundled into a single container image and can be run in isolated user space on the same shared operating system.

* Containers are lightweight, portable, and highly conducive to automation. As a result, containerization has become a cornerstone of development pipelines and application infrastructure for a variety of use cases. Understanding what containerization is, and how to implement it securely, can help your organization modernize and scale its technology stacks.
